# 1. write a program to reverse an array or a string
# solution: you can do it iteratively or recursively using arr, 0, n-1

# 2. find the minimum (or maximum) element of an array
# solution: you can first sort the array, or you can iterate or recurse 
# on the array and find the min/max

# 3. move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with
# constant extra space
# solution: you can sort the array
